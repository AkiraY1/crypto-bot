# Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Trading

This project was created in order to learn about cryptocurrency trading and the obstacles that make it difficult to turn a profit. The final bot uses triangular arbitrage on Binance. The algorithm does not turn a profit for a variety of reasons, one of the hardest to resolve being that trades are not registered fast enough to take advantage of momentary price inaccuracies on the exchange.

This project is still a work-in-progress.
